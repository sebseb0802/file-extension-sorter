# file-extension-sorter

## Overview
* A CLI-based file extension sorter that sorts a given directory into various folders based on file extension.

## Current status
* As it is a CLI-based application, I do plan on making it more user-friendly by adding a GUI (possible using Tkinter) at some point.
